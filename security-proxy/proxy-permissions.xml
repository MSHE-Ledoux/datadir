     allowByDefault: if set to true, 'allowed' list will be checked before
                     'denied' list. If URL match an urimatcher in allowed
                     list and an urimatcher in denied then URL will be
                     allowed. If URL does not match any urimatcher then it
                     will be allowed. If set to false, rules in denied
                     part will be examined before rules in allowed part.
                     If no rule match requested URL then it will be denied.

     denied: list of urimatcher, if one urimatcher match requested URL is
             denied. You can view denied as a list of urimatcher separated
             by *OR* logical operator.
     allowed: same as previous tag but if one urimatcher match requested
              URL will be allowed.
     urimatcher: each condition in one urimatcher must match to consider
                 urimatcher as matching requested URL. You can view a
                 urimatcher as a list of condition separated by a *AND*
                 logical operator.
     host: this rule will match all IP address of host specified. IP
           addresses of requested URL will be compared to all IP addresses
           of host in 'host' tag.
     domain: case insensitive regexp to match domain part of requested URL.
     port: match port of requested URL.
     path: case insensitive regexp to match path part of requested URL.

     Example with all tags:

     <permissions>
         <allowByDefault>true</allowByDefault>
         <allowed>
             <urimatcher>
                 <domain>.*\.georchestra\.org</domain>
             </urimatcher>
         </allowed>
         <denied>
             <urimatcher>
                 <host>localhost</host>
             </urimatcher>
             <urimatcher>
                 <domain>sdi.example.org</domain>
                 <port>443</port>
                 <path>/geonetwork/</path>
             </urimatcher>
         </denied>
     </permissions>

     First urimatcher will allow all requests to domain that ends by georchestra.org.
     Second urimatcher will deny access to all IP addresses of local host.
     Third urimatcher will deny access to https://sdi.georchestra.org/geonetwork/
